About the Dataset

The dataset provides information on sales transactions, including Order ID, Product, Quantity Ordered, Price, Order Date, and Purchase Address. The "Quantity Ordered" 
column tells us how many products were sold and helps us analyze sales trends over time. It also includes customer age and gender for studying buying behavior across demographics. 
The dataset contains both numeric and categorical data, requiring various analysis techniques. Overall, it gives a comprehensive view of sales data, allowing analysis by product, customer, and location.

Best Month for Sales: We aimed to find the most profitable month by calculating total monthly sales revenue. This helps in identifying the month with the highest sales, aiding in planning and resource allocation.

City with Maximum Orders: We analyzed which city had the most orders by extracting city data from purchase addresses. Visualizing this information helps in targeting key locations for marketing and distribution.

Top-Selling Products & Why: We identified the best-selling products and explored possible reasons for their success. We used sales quantity and revenue data and looked at how product prices affected sales.

Trend of Most Sold Products: We examined the sales trend of the most popular products to spot patterns and fluctuations over time. This assists in forecasting demand and optimizing inventory.

These analyses provide valuable insights for data-driven decision-making and strategic business planning.
